### üìé Important Note About File Attachments:

Due to **browser security restrictions**, files cannot be automatically attached to emails via mailto links. 

The email will:
- ‚úÖ Include ALL form data
- ‚úÖ Show the file name that was selected
- ‚úÖ Remind user to attach the file
- ‚ùå File must be manually attached by user before sending

**User needs to:**
1. See pre-filled email with all data
2. Click "Attach" in their email client
3. Select the same Kundali file they uploaded
4. Click "Send"

This is the most reliable method that works on all devices and browsers!
