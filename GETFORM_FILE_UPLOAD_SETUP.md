# 🚀 Getform.io Setup Guide - FREE File Attachments Working!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Date Hidden on Mobile ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Date and festival information was hidden on screens < 968px
- **Solution**: Updated CSS to show date on all screen sizes with responsive styling
- **Result**: Date now visible on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Issue 2: Email Attachments Not Working ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: FormSubmit.co doesn't support file attachments
- **Why Web3Forms won't work**: Web3Forms requires PAID subscription for file attachments
- **Solution**: Switched to **Getform.io** - FREE plan includes file uploads (5MB)!
- **Result**: Both forms now support file attachments completely FREE

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### File Upload Requirements:
1. **File size**: Must be under 5MB
2. **File types**: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX (most common formats supported)
3. **Form attribute**: Must have `enctype="multipart/form-data"` ✅ (already added)
4. **Internet connection**: Required for submission

### Troubleshooting:

**"Submission not received"**
- ✅ Check endpoint URL is correct (no typos)
- ✅ Verify email address in Getform dashboard
- ✅ Check spam/junk folder
- ✅ Look in Getform dashboard - submission might be there even if email delayed

**"File not attached"**
- ✅ Check file is under 5MB
- ✅ Verify file type is supported
- ✅ Ensure "File Uploads" is enabled in Getform dashboard
- ✅ Confirm `enctype="multipart/form-data"` in form tag

**"Form not redirecting"**
- ✅ Check `_redirect` URL is correct
- ✅ Make sure thank-you.html exists at the URL
- ✅ Test without file first to isolate issue

**"Reached submission limit"**
- ✅ Free plan: 50/month resets each month
- ✅ View usage in Getform dashboard
- ✅ Consider upgrading if consistently hitting limit

### Spam Protection:
The `_gotcha` field is a honeypot:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="_gotcha" style="display:none !important">
```
- Hidden from real users
- Bots fill it automatically
- Getform rejects submissions with this field filled
- Simple and effective spam prevention
